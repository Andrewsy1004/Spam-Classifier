# 📦 Machine Learning Model
The model used in this application is a Logistic Regression classifier trained on thousands of email samples to detect spam messages. It uses TF-IDF Vectorization with bigram support to transform text into numerical features that capture the importance of words and phrases in determining whether an email is spam or legitimate.
